Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for sign language letter classification.
Achieved high accuracy in classifying hand gestures into corresponding letters using a grayscale image dataset.
Implemented techniques like dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve model performance.
Analyzed the model's behavior regarding loss, accuracy, overfitting, and invariance properties.
